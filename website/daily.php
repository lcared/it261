        <blockquote>
        "The Seattle Great Wheel ride time varies based on how large the crowd is and how many gondolas we are loading for each ride. During Summer operations with larger crowds, we typically have ride times between 12-20 minutes. During Winter operations with smaller crowds, we typically have ride times between 10-15 minutes. But as always, every ride is three full revolutions of the wheel." â€• Seattlegreatwheel.com
